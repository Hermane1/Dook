                <p>This was the 1st time I got to make a detailed website using everything I learned in class, when I say it was the most stressful thing ever I mean it I am still confused on how I even got this done on time. <a href="https://github.com/Hermane1/supreme-octo-dollop">https://github.com/Hermane1/supreme-octo-dollop</a></p>

                <p>This was the 1st project I did outside my accountablity group with anyone. It was fun me and my partner got to learn how to make repos and how to fork,branch,clone and use all types of git commands for the firat time. I'm glad I got to do this I felt really good afterwards like,I actually know what I am doing. <a href="https://github.com/your-profile/project3">https://github.com/Hermane1/SmallGroupProg1</a></p>
